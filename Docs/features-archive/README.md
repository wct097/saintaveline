# Archived Features Directory

This directory contains completed feature documentation that has been archived after successful implementation and merge.

## Purpose

Archived features serve as:
- **Historical reference** for technical decisions
- **Knowledge base** of successful implementations
- **Pattern library** for similar future work
- **Audit trail** of development history
- **Learning resource** for team members

## Archive Process

Features are moved here when:
1. Implementation is complete and merged
2. All requirements are satisfied
3. Tests are passing
4. Documentation is updated
5. Feature branch is merged/deleted

## Archive Command

```bash
/feature archive <feature-name>
```

This command:
- Moves feature document from `docs/features/` to here
- Adds archive metadata (date, final branch, PR link)
- Updates status to 'archived'
- Preserves complete session history

## Naming Convention

Archived features retain their original names:
- `user-authentication.md`
- `api-rate-limiting.md`
- `data-migration.md`

Optional: Add date prefix for chronological sorting:
- `2024-11-22-user-authentication.md`

## Searchable History

Archived features can be searched for:
- **Technical decisions**: Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Problem solutions**: How issues were resolved
- **Implementation patterns**: Reusable code patterns
- **Session insights**: Effective development workflows
- **Testing strategies**: What testing approaches worked

## Best Practices

1. **Complete documentation** before archiving
2. **Include PR/issue links** for traceability
3. **Document lessons learned** in final session
4. **Preserve all context** for future reference
5. **Tag with keywords** for better searchability

## Re-activation

If an archived feature needs additional work:
1. Copy back to `docs/features/`
2. Update status from 'archived' to 'in-progress'
3. Add note about re-activation reason
4. Continue with normal feature workflow

## Retention Policy

Archived features should be retained indefinitely as they provide:
- Valuable development history
- Technical decision documentation
- Team knowledge preservation
- Audit trail for compliance

## Integration with Version Control

Archived features are:
- Committed to repository for permanence
- Tagged with release versions if applicable
- Linked to pull requests and issues
- Part of project documentation

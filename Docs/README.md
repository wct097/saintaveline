# Documentation Directory

*Generated by AI Setup Deployment Script v2.40.0 on 2026-01-12 22:11:00 UTC*

Store your project documentation, specifications, feature tracking, and technical designs here. This structure aligns with GitHub conventions and supports GitHub Pages.

## Usage Guidelines

### Architecture Directory (`/docs/architecture/`)
Design decisions, system architecture, and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):
- System design documents
- Architecture decision records
- Technical design specifications
- Integration patterns

### Guides Directory (`/docs/guides/`)
How-to guides, setup instructions, and tutorials:
- Installation guides
- Configuration documentation
- Development workflow guides
- Performance optimization guides

### Screenshots Directory (`/docs/screenshots/`)
Visual documentation and UI mockups:
- UI mockups and wireframes
- Visual flow diagrams
- Screen captures for reference
- Design system examples
- Before/after comparisons

### Features Directory (`/docs/features/`)
Active feature development tracking (managed by `/feature` command):
- Feature specifications
- Implementation progress
- Session continuity notes
- Technical decisions

### Archive Directory (`/docs/archive/`)
Deprecated or historical documentation:
- Implemented features
- Deprecated designs
- Historical decisions
- Old requirements
- Previous iterations

## Change Documentation

For complex implementations, use the change documentation template:

1. Copy `change_template.md` to a new file (e.g., `feature_xyz_changes.md`)
2. Fill in all sections completely
3. Reference in pull requests and commits
4. Move to archive when implementation is complete

See `example_change_doc.md` for a complete example.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep docs current** - Update or archive as needed
2. **Use clear naming** - `feature_name_spec.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD_decision.md`
3. **Link liberally** - Reference related docs, code, and issues
4. **Version control** - Let git track changes, don't version in filenames
5. **Stay organized** - Archive completed work promptly

## Integration with AI Tools

This structure is optimized for AI-assisted development:
- Follows GitHub conventions (`/docs/` directory)
- Supports GitHub Pages deployment
- Clear separation of content types
- Feature tracking for session continuity
- Change documentation for handoffs and reviews

## Migration from `/specs/`

If migrating from the previous `/specs/` structure:
```bash
git mv specs/archive/* docs/architecture/
git mv specs/screenshots/* docs/screenshots/
git mv specs/features/* docs/features/
git mv specs/features-archive/* docs/features-archive/
git mv specs/*.md docs/
rmdir specs/archive specs/screenshots specs/features specs/features-archive specs
```

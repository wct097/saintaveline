This directory contains AI tool documentation, best practices, and project context that AI development tools should read to understand your project and provide optimal assistance.

## Purpose

The `/ai_docs` directory serves as:
- **Persistent memory** for AI tools across sessions
- **Context repository** with project-specific information
- **Best practices hub** for AI-assisted development
- **Knowledge base** for consistent AI tool usage

## Core Files

### project_context.md
- **Project-specific information** that AI tools need
- **Technology stack and architecture** details
- **Coding standards and conventions**
- **Development workflow patterns**
- **Team-specific guidelines**

*Create this file by copying and customizing `project_context_template.md`*

### claude_code_best_practices.md
- **Comprehensive patterns** for using Claude Code effectively
- **Workflow recommendations** and optimization techniques
- **Advanced features** including thinking modes and session logging
- **Integration patterns** with other tools and development workflows
- **Session logging best practices** for debugging, learning, and collaboration

### openai_agents_sdk_best_practices.md
- **Multi-agent collaboration** patterns and architectures
- **Production-ready** agent development guidelines
- **Testing and monitoring** strategies
- **Security and performance** best practices

### testing_best_practices.md
- **Quality assurance patterns** for AI-assisted development
- **Testing strategies** for AI-generated code
- **Test automation** and CI/CD integration
- **Quality metrics** and best practices

### git_workflow_patterns.md
- **Version control patterns** for AI development
- **Collaboration workflows** with AI tools
- **Branching strategies** for AI experiments
- **Commit attribution** and quality practices

### project_context_template.md
- **Template file** for creating project-specific context
- **Comprehensive sections** covering all aspects of project information
- **Customization guidelines** and examples

## Usage by AI Tools

### Claude Code
- Use `/prime` command to load project context
- AI reads `project_context.md` for project-specific information
- References best practices for optimal assistance patterns
- Maintains consistency across development sessions
- **Leverages session logging** for debugging, learning, and team collaboration
- **Archives successful patterns** from session logs for future reference

### Other AI Tools
- Read `project_context.md` before providing assistance
- Follow documented patterns and conventions
- Reference architecture and coding standards
- Maintain consistency with team practices

## Knowledge Management

### Overview
Effective AI-assisted development benefits from systematic knowledge capture and sharing:

**Key Practices:**
- **Documentation** - Maintain comprehensive project documentation
- **Pattern Recognition** - Document successful approaches and solutions
- **Team Knowledge** - Share insights and best practices across the team
- **Continuous Learning** - Update documentation as tools and techniques evolve
- **Project History** - Keep records of important decisions and implementations

### Documentation Structure
Organize development knowledge within the AI documentation:

```
ai_docs/
├── patterns/
│   ├── successful-workflows.md
│   ├── common-solutions.md
│   └── troubleshooting-guides.md
├── decisions/
│   ├── architecture-choices.md
│   └── technology-selections.md
└── learning/
    ├── lessons-learned.md
    └── best-practices.md
```

### Knowledge Sharing
**Documentation complements AI tools:**
- **Capture patterns** from successful development work
- **Share solutions** that proved effective
- **Document decisions** made during development
- **Transfer knowledge** to team members
- **Maintain history** of important implementations

### Best Practices
- **Document regularly** - Capture insights as they occur
- **Be specific** - Include concrete examples and context
- **Stay organized** - Use consistent structure and naming
- **Share knowledge** - Make documentation accessible to the team
- **Keep current** - Update as practices and tools evolve

## Maintenance

### Keep Current
- Update `project_context.md` as project evolves
- Refresh best practices with new tool capabilities
- Document lessons learned and effective patterns
- Share improvements across team projects
- **Review documentation** - Keep patterns and insights current
- **Archive decisions** - Maintain organized historical records
- **Update practices** - Keep approaches documentation current

### Version Control
- Commit changes to AI documentation
- Track evolution of AI assistance patterns
- Maintain history of effective approaches
- Enable rollback of problematic changes
- **Version control docs** - Track important documentation
- **Maintain history** - Preserve project knowledge
